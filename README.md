# ChartAI - Intelligent Data Visualization Platform

## ðŸ¤– AI Feedback Learning System

The platform now includes an advanced AI feedback learning system that continuously improves chart recommendations based on user interactions.

### Key Features

#### ðŸ“š **Intelligent Learning**
- **User Feedback Collection**: Rate charts and provide feedback to train the AI
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI learns your preferred chart types and business context
- **Column Filtering**: Automatically avoids columns you've marked as irrelevant
- **Business Context**: Stores your business domain knowledge for better recommendations

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Training Interface**
- **Business Context**: Describe your business, key metrics, and what insights matter
- **Preferred Charts**: Specify chart types and patterns that work well for your data
- **Column Preferences**: Mark columns to ignore (IDs, internal codes, etc.)
- **Chart Types**: Select your preferred visualization types

#### ðŸ“Š **Feedback Components**
- **Star Ratings**: Rate charts from 1-5 stars
- **Insight Quality**: Rate the quality of AI-generated insights
- **Text Feedback**: Provide detailed feedback for improvement
- **Chart Pinning**: Pin your favorite charts for quick access

#### ðŸ”„ **Continuous Improvement**
- **Session State**: Immediate learning within the current session
- **Database Storage**: Persistent learning across sessions (with Supabase)
- **Dataset Matching**: Recognizes similar datasets and applies learned preferences
- **Real-time Updates**: AI recommendations improve as you provide feedback

### How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**: Use the "Train AI" interface to provide business context and preferences
2. **Chart Generation**: AI creates charts based on your preferences and business context
3. **Feedback Loop**: Rate charts and provide feedback to improve future recommendations
4. **Learning Progress**: Monitor how the AI is learning from your feedback
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Each interaction makes the AI smarter for your specific use case

### Database Schema

The system uses a `ai_feedback` table to store:
- User feedback and ratings
- Business context and preferences
- Dataset metadata for pattern matching
- Timestamps for tracking learning progress

### Usage

1. **Enable Agentic AI** in the sidebar
2. **Upload your dataset** in the Data tab
3. **Train the AI** using the training interface
4. **Generate charts** and provide feedback
5. **Monitor progress** in the AI Learning Progress section

The more you interact with the system, the better it becomes at understanding your specific data visualization needs!
